# Welcome to my mock e-Commerce site
I built this site as a part of my final project for the codecademy full-stack engineering course. The entire project is built with TypeScript.

## Backend
- The backend is a GraphQL API built using apollo server.
- Postgres is used for an RDBMS.
- Redis is used to store cookies in memory.
- TypeORM is used for type safe object-relation mapping.
- Express is used for Node.js middleware.

## Frontend
- The website is built with React.
- It is styled with the chakra package.
- Routing is done through NextJs
